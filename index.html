				Post #1: The Plan
			</div>
			<div class='blog-post-body'>
				<p>This has been a long time coming. 
				<p>I've been wanting to start blogging for about a year now, but have been struggling with figuring out where to start.
				<p>There have been tons of questions swirling around in my head, like: 
				<ul>
					<li>Blog: Roll my <a href='http://www.tandemgames.com/' target='_blank'>own</a> <a href='http://www.domainofheroes.com/' target='_blank'>site</a> <a href='http://www.aliensandrobots.com/' target='_blank'>again</a>? or use seasoned blog software with <a href='http://wordpress.org/' target='_blank'>heavy community support</a>?</li>
					<li>Host: Use a <a href='https://appharbor.com' target='_blank'>cloud</a> <a href='http://www.heroku.com/' target='_blank'>application</a>  <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/sites/' target='_blank'>host</a>? Use a cheap host that <a href='http://bluehost.com/' target='_blank'>supports simple scripts</a> for common apps? Host out of the <a href='img/posts/aarons_server_rack.jpg' target='_blank'>server rack in my house</a>?</li>
					<li>Platform: Java? .NET? "pure" HTML/JS? <a href='http://expect.sourceforge.net/cgi.tcl/'>TCL/CGI</a>? Something more <a href='http://rubyonrails.org/' target='_target'>hip</a>?</li>
					<li>Audience: Should I be connecting with <a href='http://lostechies.com/' target='_blank'>other developers</a>? Other small-business owners? Friends? Family? </li>
					<li>Content: Is this going to be a personal activity log? Professional journal? Or just another tech experiement?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As I poured through ideas and wrote down reams of notes, one thing was apparent: <span class='callout'>I was spending a lot of time and effort on the blog but not actually blogging.</span>
				<p>Last night I couldn't sleep. The kid's toy keyboard was "cleaned up" in a way that a key was being pressed repeatedly whenever the air conditioning changed the pressure in the play room. I finally got up to address the situation, and then found myself unable to fall back to sleep. 
				<p>After laying in bed for a couple of hours thinking about the blog, I finally got up to write down my ideas on paper so that I could actually fall asleep. This is common for me: the fear of forgetting an idea keeping me from drifting off into sleepytown.
				<p>This morning I get into work and checked on my RSS feed folder for .NET development. It's been a few days since I checked it, but <a href='http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx' target=_blank>this call-to-action from Scott Hanselman</a> was the final straw. The answer is simply to start blogging now and sort out the details later.
				<p>So what's the plan? Well, the plan is:
				<ul>
					<li>Roll my own site/blog from the ground up</li>
					<li>Hosted at my house in my server rack</li>
					<li>Post about all of the changes and more importantly, show the intention behind them</li>
					<li>Make this site <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog' target=_blank>publicly available on github</a> so that everyone can see how it works and see it progress</li>
					<li>Start with a single index.html file and advance the site it all the way through to a scalable, distributed system, from the ground up</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Ultimately, I'd like to think that someone new to the web development craft will be able to use this site, the posts, and the source code history as a guide to seeing what goes on behind the scenes for how to create modern web software. I'm going to start at absolute step 1, and advance steadily through the growth of a real application. 
				<p>I'd love it if you followed me on this journey. It'd be great if you could sign up for an RSS feed to get auto-notifications when I make new posts, but since this is just an index.html file at the moment, you can't. Looks like we've got a lot of work to do. Get ready for a fun ride.
				<p>For now, you can reach me on <a href='https://twitter.com/aaronkmurray' target='_blank'>Twitter @aaronkmurray</a>. Let me know what you think about this project and what features you'd like to see implemented. Here's a sample of what I have planned already:
				<ul>
					<li>Basics: CSS reset, JS framework, Cloud/CDN hosting</li>
					<li>Javascript: organizing your JS files (custom and 3rd-party), creating your own framework patterns, debugging</li>
					<li>CSS: responsive design, image bundling/sprites</li>
					<li>Build/Deploy: tools for building, bundling, and deploying the site and assets</li>
					<li>Performance: optimizing response time, payload, client-side caching, server-side caching, web-server and load balancer config</li>
					<li>Debugging: client-side debugging, server-side debugging, error logging, pro-active notifications, self-healing services, system health dashboards and reports</li>
					<li>Testing: js unit testing, server-side testing, integration testing</li>
					<li>Database: choosing a DB, using an ORM (like Entity Framework), writing your own ORM</li>
					<li>Marketing: strategy, considerations, tracking and mining your own site data</li>
					<li>Social: integration with the Majors (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.), API usage, tracking</li>
					<li>Advanced: client-side MVC, new JS paradigms and protocols for server communication, custom DBMS!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As you can see, that is a reasonably ambitious sampling of goals since we're starting with a single HTML page and no code. Let's get cracking!
