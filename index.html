				<p><em>As I mentioned in <a href='#blog-post-10'>Post 10: The SEO Plan</a>, this post is the first in a 4-part series on SEO written by guest author <a href='https://twitter.com/slivengood' target="_blank">Shawn Livengood</a> who runs the blog <a href='http://ppcwithoutpity.com/' target="_blank">ppcwithoutpity.com</a>. </em>
				<div class='guest-post-content'>
					<h3>SEO Post 1: Getting Indexed</h3>
					<p>Before you can start seeing spectacular SEO results on your site, first you have to let the search engines know that your site is there. There are a few ways to go about this:
					<ol>
						<li>Google Webmaster Tools submission</li>
						<li>Bing Webmaster Tools submission</li>
						<li>Creating an XML sitemap</li>
						<li>Getting a link from an influential, recently-cached site</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Let's go through the how-to of each one.
					<h3>Google Webmaster Tools</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Go to <a href='http://www.google.com/webmasters/' target="_blank">google.com/webmasters</a> to create an account.</li>
						<li>Once you create an account, click on the "Add A Site" button to add your URL.</li>
						<li>After you enter the URL you want to add, you'll be asked to verify that you own the site. You can do this via several different methods: through your domain name provider, uploading an HTML file to your web server, adding a special META tag to your homepage header, or by linking your Google Analytics account. Different sites and hosting configurations have different interactions with each of these verification methods. But, the most reliable (and easiest) method in my experience is the META tag addition.</li>
					</ol>
					<div class='callout'>
						<img src='img/blog/posts/post-14-3-gwt-step-3.jpg' alt='Google Webmaster Tools: Verify Site'>
						<span class='citation'>Google Webmaster Tools: Verify Site Ownership Options</span>
					</div>

					<p>Once your site is verified, you will have access to a set of tools that will help you diagnose SEO issues with your site, track inbound links and search queries, and create ways to help Google index your site. I won't get into all the ins and outs of Google Webmaster Tools here (that would take a whole series of posts), but I do want to cover a few settings that will help get your site indexed initially.
					<p>Click on the Configuration section in the navigation, and select "Settings."  You have a few options on this page. You can select your geographic target here. This will help Google understand what your local language is in, and which international Google search engines should give your site priority. Also on this page, you can choose a preferred domain. You can state that you prefer your domain with or without "www."  This will help prevent duplicate content issues by defining one canonical version of your domain name in Google's system. The third option on this page is to select the crawl rate. If you just added your site, you probably won't have the option to change this just yet. But once you get some traffic, you can return to this page to define a suggested crawl frequency for Google's spiders to re-index your site. Of course, this is just a suggestion to Google - there's no guarantee they'll actually follow your instructions.
					<p>In Google Webmaster tools, you can also upload an XML sitemap. You can perform this task in the Optimization &gt; Sitemaps section of your account. We'll go into this a little bit more in the sitemaps part of this post.
					<h3>Bing Webmaster Tools</h3>
					<p>Bing may not be as popular as Google, but it still gets enough user traffic where it makes sense to have your site indexed by them. Fortunately, they also have a webmaster tools account where you can show Bing how to index your content.
					<ol>
						<li>Go to <a href='http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster' target="_blank">bing.com/toolbox/webmaster</a></li>
						<li>Enter the URL of the site you want to add at the top of the page.</li>
						<li>Fill out the form on the next page with your personal information. You can also add a sitemap URL on this form, if you have one.</li>
						<li>Once you save your info, your site will appear on your Bing Webmaster Tools dashboard. But, you still need to verify it. Click on the "Verify Now" link next to the site URL.</li>
						<li>Bing offers you three verification methods: you can upload a special Bing XML file to your root folder in your hosting account, you can verify via a special META tag on your homepage <head> section, or you can add a unique CNAME record to your DNS.</head></li>
					</ol>
					<div class='callout'>
						<img src='img/blog/posts/post-14-10-bing-verify-site-options.jpg' alt='Bing Webmaster Tools: Verify Site Ownership'>
						<span class='citation'>Bing Webmaster Tools: Verify Site Ownership Options</span>
					</div>

					<p>Bing Webmaster Tools also has a lot of options to help your site get crawled. You can submit sitemaps, submit individual URLs, and define the crawl rate of your site. All of these options help your new site become more findable by search engine spiders.
					<h3>Creating an XML Sitemap</h3>
					<p>As I mentioned above, creating a sitemap is an important part of getting a website crawled by search engine spiders. First, some clarification: just adding a sitemap will not make your site more findable. What a sitemap does is provide a roadmap for crawlers that arrive on your site, helping them find all of the pages within your domain. A crawler has to reach your domain in the first place for a sitemap to help, and uploading that sitemap will not help anything find your domain. But, the sitemap does play an important role in assisting web crawlers with finding all of the obscure, deeply-buried pages within your site. And the more pages on your site that get found, the more pages that have the potential to show up on a web search.
					<p>If you have a small (&lt; 500 page) site, you can create a sitemap for free using the tool at <a href='http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/' target="_blank">xml-sitemaps.com</a>. Just follow the instructions on the page and you should be good to go. If you have a larger site, you may need to run a program on your web server to index and create all the entries on the sitemap. Google has a tool for this (in beta, of course) at this URL: <a href='http://code.google.com/p/googlesitemapgenerator/' target="_blank">code.google.com/p/googlesitemapgenerator/</a>. There are also dozens of other tools out there to create sitemaps, so finding an easy way to make one is only a Google search away.
					<p>Once you have a sitemap, you'll need to upload it to your web server. It must reside at this address: <em>www.your-site-name-here.com</em>/sitemap.xml. If you have to gzip your sitemap due to size, the URL of <em>www.your-site-name-here.com</em>/sitemap.xml.gz is also acceptable. Whichever URL you go with, make sure to enter this URL in your robots.txt file to ensure that the search engines know where it is. And just to be extra sure, submit that sitemap to both Google Webmaster Tools and Bing Webmaster Tools.
					<h3>Getting An Influential Link</h3>
					<p>Even after all this work, it may take a while for the search engines to find your site to speed up this process, it helps to get a strong initial link to get the ball rolling. You'll want to get a link from a site that gets cached frequently. If crawlers return to a site frequently to check for new links, the link to your site should be found quickly, meaning that the crawler will reach your site via the link and add it to the search engine's index as soon as the page with your link is cached. Also, you should make sure that the link you get is dofollow - a crawler will not pass through a nofollow link, negating the benefit of indexation.
					<p>Getting links isn't exactly easy. But, maybe you have an established site that gets decent search traffic. Or maybe you know a friend who has one. You can even reach out to an influential blogger that you admire and ask them nicely to give you a link to this new project you're working on. Be creative in your linkbuilding, and you will be rewarded.
					<p>To check on when a page was last cached by Google, you can use this tool: <a href='http://www.searchenginegenie.com/tools/google-bot-last-accessed-date.php' target="_blank">searchenginegenie.com/tools/google-bot-last-accessed-date.php</a>. Or, the SEOBook toolbar has this functionality within their browser extension. You can download it here: <a href='http://tools.seobook.com/seo-toolbar/' target="_blank">tools.seobook.com/seo-toolbar/</a>. Remember to check the cache date of the page where your link will appear. Homepages tend to get cached pretty frequently, while individual post and category pages do not.

				<p>Way back in <a href='#blog-post-8'>Post 8</a> I mentioned 2 ways to reduce the impact of images on bandwidth. The method I tackled then was to automatically compress the png images in the build script. In this post, I will show you how to further reduce the impact by creating and displaying thumbnails instead of scaling down the original image using HTML (<span class='code'>&lt;img ... <strong>width=100</strong> /&gt;</span>).
				<div class='callout'>
					<img src='img/blog/posts/post-13-request-payload-before-thumbnails-chart.png' alt='Request payload before thumbnails'>
					<span class='citation'>Request payload before using thumbnails (inspected using Firefox, <a href='http://getfirebug.com/' target="_blank">FireBug</a>, and <a href='http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/' target="_blank">YSlow</a> plugin)</span>
				</div>
				<p>As you can see from the chart, fully 98% of the data that users have to download from the site is for images. Of those 24 images, 12 were fullsize blog post screenshots, which weighed in at a portly 1.17MB. Those 12 little screenshot previews accounted 77% of the size for the entire page - and that is after we compressed the images to reduce about one-third of the filesize.
				<p>I made a sample thumbnail by resizing the image down to 100 pixels wide produced a new preview image that was 90% smaller than the original. The prospect of reducing 77% of the entire request payload by 90% got me excited. 
				<p>Given that I still despise the copy/paste portion of creating new blog posts, and knowing that I don't want to make it harder on myself to release a blog post, I wanted a solution that was 100% automated. There already exists a <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog-tools/blob/master/build/build-aaronkmurray-site.bat' target="_blank">build script for this site</a> so I knew that I wanted to tie into that step. 
				<p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/3739310.js"> </script>
				<p>Notes on the batch file:
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class='code'>FOR</span> loop gets a list of all of the screenshot files that don't have "thumb" in the name</li>
					<li><span class='code'>SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION</span> is special inside of loops so that variables can be set with each iteration</li>
					<li>A new thumbnail file is only created if one does not exist already</li>
					<li><span class='code'>convert.exe</span> file comes from the free image utility library <a href='http://www.imagemagick.org'>ImageMagick</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>The result is that the sum total filesize of the first 12 post thumbnail images is 111KB (a savings of over 1 megabyte). I also removed the <span class='code'>width=100</span> attributes from the previews as they are no longer necessary. Not too shabby for a few lines of code added to the build script.

				<p>Alrighty. Today's post is simple - but something that is very visible to users. The Favicon.
				<p>A Favicon is the little icon that appears in the browser tab/address bar. 
				<div class='callout'>
					<img src='img/blog/posts/post-12-favico-browser-comparo.png' title='Favicon browser comparison'>
					<span class='citation'>Favicons as they are shown in Firefox 14, Chrome 21, and Internet Explorer 9</span>
				</div>
				<p>In 1999, Microsoft introduced Favicons for the purpose of having an icon to display in the Favorites (bookmarks) menu on Internet Explorer. 2 things were done that (nowadays) goes against some web principles:
				<ol>
					<li>Use of the Windows .ico file format
						<ul><li>example: favicon.ico instead of favicon.jpg</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>Default convention for the file location off the root of the site's domain URL, which meant the location didn't have to be specified in HTML
						<ul>
							<li>www.aaronkmurray.com/favicon.ico</li>
							<li>This limits the webmaster's ability to place the file anywhere, or even on a different server, without mapping OS folders or making URL-rewrite rules (we'll cover those later)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>As a result, even though you can now specify any location and filetype that you want for your favicon, I still recommend serving an actual favicon.ico from your root for 2 reasons:
				<ol>
					<li>Many browsers and RSS readers will still make requests to this location looking for an icon</li>
					<li>You'll cut down on the 404 (File Not Found) error noise that will show up in your hit logging</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Adding a modern Favicon is simple: <span class='code'>&lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.png" type="image/png" /&gt;</span>
				<p>But you should still slap a <a href='/favicon.ico' target="_blank">favicon.ico</a> in your root.
				<p>If you don't know how to make a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)' target="_blank">.ico file</a>, you can use a free site like <a href='http://www.convertico.com/' target="_blank">convertico.com</a> to upload an image and get an .ico file back.

				<p>Bugs! Already there are bugs :) 
				<p>A colleague of mine mentioned to me that whenever I release a new post, his reader fills shows that <em>all</em> of the posts appear as new posts.
				<p><img src='img/blog/posts/post-11-google-reader.png' alt='Google Reader showing multiple new posts with each post'>
				<p>This is an interesting problem caused by the fact that I wasn't defining a <span class='code'>&lt;guid&gt;</span> element in the RSS feed, nor a corresponding <span class='code'>&lt;id&gt;</span> element in the atom feed. These elements are what feed readers (like Google Reader) use to determine if a post/entry is new or not. If the entry doesn't have an ID, it'll always be treated as new. Obviously I need to add these Ids.
				<p>So, how should I choose a unique Id for each post? Some say that a <a href='http://www.taguri.org/' target="_blank">TAG Uri</a> should be used. While that seems like a nice way to ensure the creation of a unique id, I don't really want to put a lot of effort into building these Ids by hand (since we're still not using a DB yet). Additionally, I don't care what the Ids are because they are only going to be used by machines, so they don't need to be fancy. 
				<p>I think this solution calls for a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier' target="_blank">Guid</a>. In fact, RSS feeds explicitly have an element for it. Bingo.
				<p>The next step was realizing that I didn't want to have another manual step in the process of releaing a new post. I don't want to <a href='http://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx' target="_blank">generate</a> <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.guid.newguid.aspx' target="_blank">a</a> <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html#randomUUID()' target="_blank">guid</a> by hand each time. I also didn't want to store a list of guids that are mapped to blog posts in some external file. 
				<p>My solution for now while we're still in hand-coding mode is to add a step to rssgen that will search for a guid in each post, and if it doesn't find one, it adds it. 
				<p>That means that as a write a post, in the post html I have this empty stub:
				<ul><li><span class='code'>&lt;div class='blog-post-guid'&gt;</span></li></ul>
				<p>I <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog-tools/commit/70f220e27e750a3f7b339b7bcb7310e0e63620d6' target="_blank">updated rssgen</a> to add the guids inside those stubs, and then re-save the index.html file during the build process. And if I ever want to resend an update out for an old post, I can simply update the guid.
				<p>This project is pretty interesting for me so far. These solutions are not the way I normally operate because I typically stand on the shoulders of giants and leverage frameworks that handle many of the details like this. My hope is that the readers learn a few things along the way, though I have a feeling that this project just may radically challenge many of my standard processes and assumptions about web development.
				<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> September 14, 2012:
				<p>Ironically, I had to add more changes to keep from spamming the feed readers. The changes included keeping the date timestamps from changing which would trigger a refetch/display as well.

				<p>As outlined in <a href='#blog-post-1'>The Plan</a>, a major goal for this site is to provide an inside view on creating a website from the ground up. Large parts of that inside-out view is a visual history as well as full source code with revision history. While that captures the technical aspects of the site, there are other components that go into making a site. 
				<p>I hinted at this in <a href='#blog-post-4'>Post 4: For the Machines</a>. Another major component for creating a site is the plan to go from simply being "out there on the Internet" to being easy to find from any major search engine. Much of the steps that need to be taken are lumped into the phrase <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization' target="_blank">Search Engine Optimization</a>, or SEO for short.
				<p>This is probably the most overlooked part of developing a site. Next week I'm going to start a 4-part series on SEO, in collaboration with guest author <a href='http://ppcwithoutpity.com/' target="_blank">Shawn Livengood who runs the blog ppcwithoutpity.com</a>.
				<p>The prep for that series, it is prudent to start tracking some key SEO metrics as soon as possible. That way we'll be able to see how the changes affect those metrics over time.
				<p>I won't go into too much detail know about each of these metrics, but here they are captured for historical purposes:
				<ul>
					<li>From Google:
						<ul>
							<li><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank' target="_blank">PageRank</a>: 0/10</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>From <a href='http://www.seomoz.org/' target="_blank">seoMoz</a> and <a href='http://www.opensiteexplorer.org' target="_blank">opensiteexplorer.org</a>:
						<ul>
							<li><a href='http://www.seomoz.org/learn-seo/domain-authority' target="_blank">Domain Authority</a>: <a href='http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/links?site=www.aaronkmurray.com' target="_blank">10/100</a></li>
							<li><a href='http://www.seomoz.org/learn-seo/mozrank' target="_blank">MozRank</a>: <a href='http://moonsy.com/mozrank/' target="_blank">2.97</a></li>
							<li>Linking Root Domains: <a href='http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/domains?site=www.aaronkmurray.com' target="_blank">2</a></li>
							<li>Total Links (inbound): <a href='http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/links?site=www.aaronkmurray.com' target="_blank">5</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>

				<span>Post 9: IIS Static File Compression in web.config</span>

				<p>Quick post here, while we're on the topic of saving a few bytes. I'm making 2 changes that will save some bandwidth:
				<ol>
					<li>Removing the useless Response Header "X-Powered-By" that gets added by IIS</li>
					<li>Configure text (html, css) and javascript (js, json) files to be gzip'd automatically when the browser can handle it (ex: Accept-Encoding:gzip)</li>
				</ol>
				<div class='callout'>
					<img src='img/blog/posts/post-9-request-sniff-1.png' alt='Request details before web.config changes'>
					<span class='citation'>Request details before web.config changes (inspected using Chrome Developer Tools)</span>
				</div>
				<p>First of all - the Response Header "X-Powered-By" is a waste of 20 incompressible bytes (because they are in the header and the older HTTP protocol <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5333367/http-header-compression' target="_blank">does not support header compression</a> like the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY' target="_blank">SPDY protocol</a> does). From now on, every response sent from webserver will be 20 bytes lighter. Sweet!
				<p>Secondly, we want to make sure that text files get compressed before they are sent to the client. Typically you can expect gzip'd files to be fully 2/3rds smaller than their uncompressed bretheren. In the case of this home page (index.html), the payload went from a hearty 39.67KB to a relatively svelte 12.83KB - a 67.7% savings!

				<p>Alrighty, let's talk about bandwidth for a moment. Two and a half weeks ago, this site was started as a single HTML page and no external file includes aside from a screenshot. The purpose of the screenshot was to capture a visual change history of the blog so that readers could easily see how the site changed with each post without having to get the <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog' target="_blank">code from github</a> at a certain point in time and view the site locally.
				<p>These images are saved as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics' target="_blank">PNG</a> files, which is a lossless image format meaning that all of the original image data is still intact. Unlike <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG' target="_blank">JPEG</a> files, PNG files won't mess with the fine details of your image in order to make the file size smaller. This is both good and bad.
				<div class='callout'>
					<img src='img/blog/posts/post-8-png-vs-jpg.png' alt='PNG vs JPEG visual comparison. Source: jonmiles.co.uk'>
					<span class='citation'>Image comparing PNG (left) vs JPEG (right) detail</span>
				</div>
				<p>The upside is that the screenshots look just like my screen did when I took them. The downside is that the files are bigger than a comparative jpeg file.
				<p>So there are two main actions that should be taken here:
				<ol>
					<li>Reduce the filesize via compression utilities</li>
					<li>Create separate thumbnail images and reference those for the previews</li>
				</ol>
				<p>For this post, I decided to tackle the compression issue first, even though creating thumbnails would have a bigger effect, simply because the utility that I wrote is more useful universally.
				<p>The utility I just created, called <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog-tools/imgsqz' target="_blank">imgsqz</a> (image squeeze for lack of creativity), has the following purpose:
				<ul>
					<li>Be executed as part of the "Build" process for this site</li>
					<li>Batch process entire folders full of images to compress them</li>
					<li>Not waste time try to recompress images that have already been compressed (because compression can take a long time)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I've checked in the tool so that you can look through the source code, but effectively just digs through a folder (and subfolders) looking for PNG files, and then trying to compress them. It keeps track of the files that it has compressed so that subsequent runs are only working on new/changed files. Using it is fairly simple:
				<p><span class='code'>imgsqz.exe -s=c:\FolderWithImages</span>
				<p>It's now part of the <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog-tools/blob/master/build/build-aaronkmurray-site.bat' target="_blank">build script for this site</a>, so that all PNG images from now on will be optimized before they hit the internet for consumption.
				<p>Here are the results for some of the files on this site:
				<table id='table-png-compression-results'>
					<tr><th>File</th><th>Original Size</th><th>New Size</th><th>% Saved</th></tr>
					<tr><td><a href='img/blog/screenshots/post-1.png' target="_blank">img/blog/screenshots/post-1.png</a></td><td>103 KB</td><td>86 KB</td><td>16.4%</td></tr>
					<tr><td><a href='img/blog/screenshots/post-2.png' target="_blank">img/blog/screenshots/post-2.png</a></td><td>90 KB</td><td>74 KB</td><td>17.7%</td></tr>
					<tr><td><a href='img/blog/screenshots/post-3.png' target="_blank">img/blog/screenshots/post-3.png</a></td><td>97 KB</td><td>68 KB</td><td>30.2%</td></tr>
					<tr><td><a href='img/blog/screenshots/post-4.png' target="_blank">img/blog/screenshots/post-4.png</a></td><td>88 KB</td><td>49 KB</td><td>44.8%</td></tr>
					<tr><td><a href='img/blog/screenshots/post-5.png' target="_blank">img/blog/screenshots/post-5.png</a></td><td>122 KB</td><td>104 KB</td><td>13.3%</td></tr>

				</table>
				<p>Each KB of savings is worth a tiny bit of load time and a tiny bit of bandwidth. Over time these savings will add up nicely.

				<p>Now that we've got a way for visitors to subscribe to the site to get notified when new posts happen, let's start capturing traffic stats using <a href='https://www.quantcast.com/aaronkmurray.com' target="_blank">Quantcast</a>. 
				<p>After you sign up for a free/basic Quantcast account, you can "start quantifying" your traffic by entering your domain name and generating a snippet of html/js that will ping their servers each time someone loads up your page. Simply slap that down at the bottom of your page for now, and we can start getting a rough idea of traffic stats. 
				<p>That snippet is polite because it does 2 things:
				<ul>
					<li>Try to load the tracking script using the <a href='http://davidwalsh.name/html5-async' target="_blank">async attribute</a>, which <a href='http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/01/13/javascript-performance/' target="_blank">speeds</a> up the responsiveness of the site</li>
					<li>Fallback to <a href='http://www.ehow.com/how_5277834_use-pixel-tracking.html' target="_blank">pixel tracking image</a> when javascript is unavailable</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Simple, effective, and good enough for now.
				<p>Note: it will take a few days before the stats for this site show up on Quantcast.

				<p>Alrighty - creating a new blog these days pratically assumes that readers will be provided with an <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS' target="_blank">RSS</a> or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)' target="_blank">Atom</a> feed so that readers can 'subscribe' and get notified when new posts are made. I don't even follow blogs that lack such a basic service feature. 
				<p>Ironically, in the interest of starting from absolute square 1, this blog lacked an <a href='http://aaronkmurray.com/feeds/feed-rss.xml' target="_blank">RSS feed</a>. That was one of the more challenging pieces that I had to get over mentally when considering doing a blog this way. Fortunately, the thought of losing potential followers was ultimately outweighed by the principle of the project.
				<p>That said, getting an RSS feed up ASAP was <em>very important</em> to me...even more important than other basics like choosing a database. This leads to an interesting chicken/egg problem however. How will I provide an RSS feed without a database? Am I going to copy/paste even more HTML into an XML file for a RSS feed? What about the Atom feed? Should that be another set of copying/pasting/formatting? Should I just buck up, pick a db, but not mention it until later? 
				<p>Well, given that this site is a fairly unique project, I'm open to fairly unique solutions as we trod down this path. So what is the solution to the feed problem? Parsing.
				<p>Considering my disdain for copying and pasting, and the lack of a database to draw from, I wrote a <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog-tools/tree/master/rss/rssgen/rssgen' target="_blank">little parser</a> that would read the HTML from this site and produce <a href='http://aaronkmurray.com/feeds/feed-rss.xml' target="_blank">RSS</a> and <a href='http://aaronkmurray.com/feeds/feed-atom.xml' target="_blank">Atom</a> feeds automatically.
				<p>Running that tool now becomes the first step in the "build" process for this site. That means that the current process for making and releasing a change to this site is now:
				<ul>
					<li>Edit this index.html file</li>
					<li>Run my new <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog-tools/blob/master/build/build-aaronkmurray-site.bat'>build script</a></li>
					<li>Commit and Push the changes to <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog' target='_blank'>github</a></li>
					<li>Remote into the webserver hosting this site</li>
					<li>Run my new <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog-tools/blob/master/release/release-aaronkmurray-site.bat'>release script</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>While still far from ideal, this is better than <a href='#blog-post-1'>the original</a> process, and it highlights the important phases in the make/build/release process. In upcoming posts, we'll rely more heavily on these automation points and add many steps to them that handle many of the problems that still need to be solved.

				<p>The purpose of this post is to assist the machines that will be "reading" the site. 
				<p>There are a couple of simple things that we need to do:
				<ul>
					<li>Create a <a href='http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html' target='_blank'>robots.txt</a> file for communicating instructions with web crawlers</li>
					<li>Add <span class='code'>&lt;meta&gt;</span> tags to help browsers and search engines</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You'll notice that this site's <a href='robots.txt' target='_blank'>robots.txt file</a> is fairly empty. One interesting note is the line <span class='code'>Disallow: /BadBotHoneyPot/</span>
				<p>I'll go over that in the future, but for now, I'll just say that we'll use that as a trap to identify "bad" crawlers so that we can automatically block them should we choose.
				<p>As for the <span class='code'>&lt;meta&gt;</span> tags:
				<ul>
					<li><span class='code'>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span>
						<ul>
							<li>This meta tag needs to be near the top of the HTML file (before any text).</li>
							<li>If it is not, or it is missing, then the browser will just try to figure out the character encoding set on it's own.</li>
							<li>You will typically only run across the need to include this once you start dealing with localization of your site.</li>
							<li>More info <a href='http://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/MetaCharsetAttribute' target='_blank'>here</a>
						</li></ul>
					
					<li><span class='code'>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1"&gt;</span>
						<ul>
							<li>This tag basically does two things.</li>
							<li>#1: Tell Internet Explorer to use it's <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325(v=vs.85).aspx' target='_blank'>most modern mode available</a> (as opposed to IE trying to determine which mode it should run in for best compatibility)</li>
							<li>#2: Tells browsers with <a href='http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/chrome-frame-getting-started' target='_blank'>Google Chrome Frame</a> installed to render using GCF instead of their native renderer (Uncommon, mostly to help old slow browsers)</li>
							<li></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class='code'>&lt;meta name="author" content="Aaron Murray, akmurray@gmail.com"&gt;</span>
						<ul>
							<li>Tell the crawler who authored this page</li>
							<li>Tell any users who view your source how to contact you if needed</li>
							<li>This is more uncommon for sites that have multiple contributors</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class='code'>&lt;meta name="description" content="..."&gt;</span>

				<p>Alrighty, so we have a plan, we've got the code up on <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog' target='_blank'>github</a> for the world to see, and we have made a couple small changes to make publishing *slightly* less painful via some scripts to automate a couple of steps.
				<p>Despite my guts screaming out for functionality, something has to be done about the visuals around here. The look is way too 1994, and not in a cool 1994 sort of way.
				<p>I'm going to start attaching a screenshot of the site with each post so that in the future we can easily view the visual progress that is being made. This will be easier than checking out snapshot from the <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog/commits/master/' target='_blank'>github commit history</a> and running the site locally. In the future this will be harder for folks to do once we get distributed and have various databases powering the content. Fun stuff!
				<p>Back to reality - let's spruce this place up. For all of the newbs out there, the best way to fancy up the visuals on a web page is to sprinkle a little <a href='http://www.w3schools.com/css/' target='_blank'>CSS</a> love around. Quickly you'll learn about one of the most loved (hated) aspects of web development: browser differences. Luckily there are <a href='http://www.alistapart.com/' target='_blank'>resources</a> out there to help. For now we won't get into the weeds, but let's just say that for nearly 2 decades we've been struggling with browser differences and there is no end in sight, but at least there is a lot of <a href='http://html5.org/' target='_blank'>hope</a> that things will get better over the next decade as <a href='http://www.ie6countdown.com/' target='_blank'>older browsers start to die off</a>.
				<p>Step 1: very basic <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface' target='_blank'>UI</a>/<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design' target='_blank'>UX</a> stuff:
				<ul>
					<li>Visually split up the site header from the posts</li>
					<li>Split up the post from each other</li>
					<li>Format certain types of text (<span>like code</span>)</li>
					<li>Enable a way to link directly to a specific post</li>
					<li>Add some content to the footer area of the page</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Let's assume that we'll use <span class='code'>&lt;div&gt;</span> tags for HTML structure/grouping, and that text should be in either a <span class='code'>&lt;span&gt;</span> or a <span class='code'>&lt;p&gt;</span> tag.
				<p>Using css, we can add some a style for blog posts that have a <span class='code'>&lt;span&gt;</span> tag with a css class of <span class='code'>&lt;code&gt;</span>. These matching tags will be in a different monospace font to make look them more computery. Easy.
				<ul>
					<li><span class='code'>&lt;style&gt; .blog-post-body span.code {font-family: monospace, Courier, Lucidatypewriter; } &lt;/style&gt;</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>To enabling linking directly to a post, we're going to use the old-school method of using <span class='code'>name</span> attributes and <span class='code'>#</span> links. I know this is absurd in the days of <a href='http://www.bloggingbasics101.com/2008/11/what-is-a-permalink/' target='_blank'>permalinks</a> and SEO friendliness, but we haven't written the permalink code yet, so we suffer for now. I'm doing this for your own benefit here folks - it's my <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank' target='_blank'>PageRank</a> that will suffer. When we fix this later, it'll also be a great time to talk about the joys of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring' target='_blank'>refactoring</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)' target='_blank'>brown-field</a> upgrades.

				<p>Already there is pain. Currently, my brand new process when I want to write a new post is:
					<ul>
						<li>Open up my <a href='http://www.editplus.com/' target='_blank'>text editor</a> of choice</li>
						<li>Copy and paste the HTML for a post from my previous post</li>
						<li>Edit the old HTML</li>
						<li>Save and preview the file (testing testing testing)</li>
						<li>Fix my bugs (remember to edit the timestamp, post tags, etc)</li>
						<li>Commit the changes to <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog' target='_blank'>github</a> using <a href='http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/' target='_blank'>TortoiseGit</a></li>
						<li>Push the changes to <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog' target='_blank'>github</a> using <a href='http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/' target='_blank'>TortoiseGit</a> (Manually enter username and password each time in the prompt boxes)</li>
						<li>Remote into the webserver hosting this site</li>
						<li>Pull the changes from github to a local folder</li>
						<li>Copy the files to the IIS folder hosting the site</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Ugh. No fun already. I know we can do better than that. First up, let's automate a couple of those steps.
				<ul>
					<li>Install <a href='http://msysgit.github.com/' target='_blank'>Git for Windows</a> (<a href='http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/02/git-for-windows/' target='_blank'>how-to</a>)</li>
					<li>Select the option for "Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt" so that we can write scripts to do our work</li>
					<li>Make sure that worked (open a Command Prompt, type in "git" and hit Enter</li>
					<li>Clone the github repo to a local directory. <span class='code'>c:\code\git>git clone https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog c:\code\git\aaronkmurray-blog</span></li>
					<li>Make a new Windows .bat file that will download latest code and copy to local website folder:
						<ul>
							<li><span class='code'>cd c:\code\git\aaronkmurray-blog</span></li>
							<li><span class='code'>git pull https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog</span></li>
							<li><span class='code'>xcopy /Y /E /R /V /I "c:\code\git\aaronkmurray-blog" "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aaronkmurray"</span></li>
							<li><span class='code'>REM pause</span></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Now we can just run that file on the webserver and it'll fetch the latest source from github and push it to the website's folder. 
				<p>Next up, let's take out the step of entering a username/password each time when doing the <span class='code'>git push</span>. <a href='http://www.programmoria.com/2012/02/saving-tortoisegit-password.html' target='_blank'>Here is an article</a> that describes the simple step of creating a batch file, and then running it, enter your username and password, and it creates the file that TortoiseGit needs so that you don't have to enter those manually anymore.
				<p>Far from perfect, but we're taking baby steps here ;)

				<p>This has been a long time coming. 
				<p>I've been wanting to start blogging for about a year now, but have been struggling with figuring out where to start.
				<p>There have been tons of questions swirling around in my head, like: 
				<ul>
					<li>Blog: Roll my <a href='http://www.tandemgames.com/' target='_blank'>own</a> <a href='http://www.domainofheroes.com/' target='_blank'>site</a> <a href='http://www.aliensandrobots.com/' target='_blank'>again</a>? or use seasoned blog <a href='http://dasblog.codeplex.com/' target='_blank'>software</a> with <a href='http://wordpress.org/' target='_blank'>heavy community support</a>?</li>
					<li>Host: Use a <a href='https://appharbor.com' target='_blank'>cloud</a> <a href='http://www.heroku.com/' target='_blank'>application</a>  <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/sites/' target='_blank'>host</a>? Use a cheap host that <a href='http://bluehost.com/' target='_blank'>supports simple scripts</a> for common apps? Host out of the <a href='img/blog/posts/post-1-aarons_server_rack.jpg' target='_blank'>server rack in my house</a>?</li>
					<li>Platform: Java? .NET? "pure" HTML/JS? <a href='http://expect.sourceforge.net/cgi.tcl/'>TCL/CGI</a>? Something more <a href='http://rubyonrails.org/' target='_target'>hip</a>?</li>
					<li>Audience: Should I be connecting with <a href='http://lostechies.com/' target='_blank'>other developers</a>? Other small-business owners? Friends? Family? </li>
					<li>Content: Is this going to be a personal activity log? Professional journal? Or just another tech experiement?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As I poured through ideas and wrote down reams of notes, one thing was apparent: <span class='callout'>I was spending a lot of time and effort on the blog but not actually blogging.</span>
				<p>Last night I couldn't sleep. The kid's toy keyboard was "cleaned up" in a way that a key was being pressed repeatedly whenever the air conditioning changed the pressure in the play room. I finally got up to address the situation, and then found myself unable to fall back to sleep. 
				<p>After laying in bed for a couple of hours thinking about the blog, I finally got up to write down my ideas on paper so that I could actually fall asleep. This is common for me: the fear of forgetting an idea keeping me from drifting off into sleepytown.
				<p>This morning I get into work and checked on my RSS feed folder for .NET development. It's been a few days since I checked it, but <a href='http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx' target="_blank">this call-to-action from Scott Hanselman</a> was the final straw. The answer is simply to start blogging now and sort out the details later.
				<p>So what's the plan? Well, the plan is:
				<ul>
					<li>Roll my own site/blog from the ground up</li>
					<li>Hosted at my house in my server rack</li>
					<li>Post about all of the changes and more importantly, show the intention behind them</li>
					<li>Make this site <a href='https://github.com/akmurray/aaronkmurray-blog' target="_blank">publicly available on github</a> so that everyone can see how it works and see it progress</li>
					<li>Start with a single index.html file and advance the site it all the way through to a scalable, distributed system, from the ground up</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Ultimately, I'd like to think that someone new to the web development craft will be able to use this site, the posts, and the source code history as a guide to seeing what goes on behind the scenes for how to create modern web software. I'm going to start at absolute step 1, and advance steadily through the growth of a real application. 
				<p>I'd love it if you followed me on this journey. It'd be great if you could sign up for an RSS feed to get auto-notifications when I make new posts, but since this is just an index.html file at the moment, you can't. Looks like we've got a lot of work to do. Get ready for a fun ride.
				<p>For now, you can reach me on <a href='https://twitter.com/aaronkmurray' target='_blank'>Twitter @aaronkmurray</a>. Let me know what you think about this project and what features you'd like to see implemented. Here's a sample of what I have planned already:
				<ul>
					<li>Basics: CSS reset, JS framework, Cloud/CDN hosting</li>
					<li>Javascript: organizing your JS files (custom and 3rd-party), creating your own framework patterns, debugging</li>
					<li>CSS: responsive design, image bundling/sprites</li>
					<li>Build/Deploy: tools for building, bundling, and deploying the site and assets</li>
					<li>Performance: optimizing response time, payload, client-side caching, server-side caching, web-server and load balancer config</li>
					<li>Debugging: client-side debugging, server-side debugging, error logging, pro-active notifications, self-healing services, system health dashboards and reports</li>
					<li>Testing: js unit testing, server-side testing, integration testing</li>
					<li>Database: choosing a DB, using an ORM (like Entity Framework), writing your own ORM</li>
					<li>Marketing: strategy, considerations, tracking and mining your own site data</li>
					<li>Social: integration with the Majors (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.), API usage, tracking</li>
					<li>Advanced: client-side MVC, new JS paradigms and protocols for server communication, custom DBMS!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As you can see, that is a reasonably ambitious sampling of goals since we're starting with a single HTML page and no code. Let's get cracking!
